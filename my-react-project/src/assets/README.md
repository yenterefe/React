- To run this application, please install React and Axios
- For this project, I wanted to recreate last week's assignment by combining all I have laerned so far. I wanted to use API's and React
- In React, I used props and useState to create a dictionary application
- I chose a difficult exercise so I can replicate  real website functionality on a small scale
  - I first create all my application in the App.jsx file and once I got that working, I refactored my code by creating different React components.
